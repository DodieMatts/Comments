Feel free to check out our demo here. Tip Calculator A calulator that simultaneously calculates tip ammounts on your mobile phone. The iOS application was built in swift in xCode. The open source files and gif demo can be found here. JS Drumkit An audio drumkit made with JavaScript by associating keys and their keyCodes with audio sounds. It works similarly to a digital piano. You can check out its code here."},
